It was first forked from <https://github.com/crev-dev/crev-proofs>

I wanted to unfork it, but Github can only rename+import to achieve something similar.

I renamed it to crev-proofs-old and imported it as crev-proofs.

## Open-source and free as a beer

My open-source projects are free as a beer (MIT license).  
I just love programming.  
But I need also to drink. If you find my projects and tutorials helpful, please buy me a beer by donating to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/LucianoBestia).  
You know the price of a beer in your local bar ;-)  
So I can drink a free beer for your health :-)
